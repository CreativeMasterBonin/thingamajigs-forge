<p>As with modding any game, this code has always been in the gray area for MC. As such, notices are posted here to make clear what this mod's purpose is and what rights it has. We don't own any code that is derivative of MC (in any form), and we try to stay clear of pushing boundaries.</p>
<p>Forge is a property of a company, and we also don't own its code either, but because we use it (and it uses some MC code to make it possible to mod), we have put notices about MC code usage. This mod tries to comply with the MC M.U.G. and E.U.L.A.</p>

<p>Some code here can be used in other mods, or you can try to contribute code. Before we make any drastic changes, it needs to be approved first. Backups are frequent for changes that break code.
Note: We prefer if you just suggest features to the original repository versus this one. This one is for code hosting only, not for suggestions or bug reports.
